 What I Learned

This project was done as part of my SIWES (Student Industrial Work Experience Scheme). Through this project, I gained:

-  Understanding of smart contracts  
-  How ERC-20 Tokens work  
-  How to deploy tokens using Remix IDE  
-  How to connect MetaMask wallet to Remix  
-  Using Sepolia Testnet & adding tokens to wallet manually  
-  Writing clean, professional smart contract code with OpenZeppelin
